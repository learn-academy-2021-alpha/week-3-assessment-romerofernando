## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Ruby is a programing language that balances functional programming and imperative programing. It is meant to feel more natural. 
- Object oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions. 
- RSpec testing tool in Ruby to test the behavior of behavior driven development. 
- Instance variable are initialized by the constructor. these are changed by the mothods of the object. 
- Ruby blocks is a chunck of code which you can assign a block name and then recall at a later time. 
- Ruby hashes a collection of ke-value pairs similar to an array excpet that indexing is don via key of any object type and not an integer index.
